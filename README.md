# Calendar

>📛[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r) - World famous calendar, which has simple design, inspired me to recreate its' main functionality 

>### 🔗[Live Demo](https://google-event-calendar.netlify.app/)


>🧰Technologies Used: 
- Vanilla JS
- Local Storage
- Webpack
- date-fns
- HTML Templates
- CSS3

>📚About the Project:

 I've wanted to implement Component paradigma, so used HTML Templates\
 Using them turned out to be fun and really soul-warming\
 All Calendar and Modal funcitonality I've wrapped in Class so it's possible to recreate same Objects with same methods and fields \
 Local Storage was chosen as key to security! lmao\
